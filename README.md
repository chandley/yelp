Paired with Clare Tembath

### Problem

### Languages/Platforms/Tools

| Languages | Technologies  | Testing Frameworks| Misc
| :-------------------------------------------- |:--------------|:-----------|:----|
| Ruby      | Rails         | Rspec             |  Devise|
| HTML      | Postgres      | Cucumber          |  Paperclip |
| CSS       | Angularjs     |             | Amazon webservices
|           | Nodejs        |

### Solution

### Images

### To do

Amazon S3 serving of images is not implemented

### Learning points

Best to keep API keys as environment variables - can't then be uploaded to Github by accident
Rails is a useful framework for database based applications with a regular structure
It's desirable to keep logic out of views and controllers
Use of gems such as devise and paperclip
